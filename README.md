# Estate-deal

### Built a real estate application using the Django framework & PostgreSQL

A practical backend project which takes a list of requirements from a fictional company to build a real estate application using Django. Used a basic html/css Bootstrap 4 theme and turned it into a real working application with an admin area to manage resources including property listings, realtors &amp; contact inquiries.
